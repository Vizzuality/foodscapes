## Crops
Dominant or most productive crop per pixel area.

#### Geographic coverage
Global

#### Spatial resolution
Resampled to 5 km

#### Date of content
2010

### Description
This dataset represents the most productive crop per pixel area, and it has been produced from the
[Spatial Production Allocation Model (SPAM)](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/PRFF8V).
IFPRI's SPAM uses a cross-entropy approach to make plausible estimates of crop distribution within disaggregated units.
Moving the data from coarser units such as countries and sub-national provinces,
to finer units such as grid cells, reveals spatial patterns of crop performance,
creating a global grid-scape at the confluence between geography and agricultural production systems.
Improving spatial understanding of crop production systems allows policymakers and donors
to better target agricultural and rural development policies and investments,
increasing food security and growth with minimal environmental impacts.

## Crop Groups
Dominant crop group

#### Geographic coverage
Global

#### Spatial resolution
Resampled to 5 km

### Description
Grouped crops covered by SPAM into ten crop groups: Cereals, Pulses and Legumes,
Roots and Tubers, Fruit and Nuts, Oilseed crops, Sugar crops, Fibres, Stimulants, Vegetables, and Other crops.
These groupings were chosen based on similar cultivation forms, practices, or their commonly
associated cultivation such as cereals and oil crops in animal feed production. We then
calculated for each crop group and grid cell the total production area relative to the total area
of cropland, resulting in a series of maps highlighting which crop group is predominantly grown
in an area.
