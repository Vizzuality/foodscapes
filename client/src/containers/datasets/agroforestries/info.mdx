## Grassland ecoregions suitable for silvopastoral

#### Geographic coverage

### Description
Given the large extent of grassland and pastures, converting these to silvopastoral systems that
store larger amounts of carbon while often maintaining or increasing feed productivity suggests
substantial potential for CO 2 sequestration (Lal, 2020) . Besides this benefit, such systems
frequently provide additional income to farmers, provide shading for livestock where this is
beneficial, and contribute to biodiversity as well as water and climate regulation (Rosenstock et
al., 2019) .

### Methodology
We consider all grassland and pasture areas according to (Ramankutty et al., 2008) in pixels
that have ruminants reported in (Gilbert et al., 2018) as grazed land as a first step in the
suitability mapping. To account for water constraints, we exclude pixels with an aridity index &lt;
0.2, which is the threshold between arid and semi-arid climate, based on the dataset by
(Trabucco and Zomer, 2019). This thresholds also compares well with the 90 th percentile of
silvopasture trials (n=35) compiled in (Ma et al., 2020) , which is at AI &lt; 0.18.
We distinguish two intensities of trees in pastures: (I) silvorpastures with moderate to high tree
density and (II) parkland with low tree density. Silvopastures are considered suitable where the
above criteria are met and forest biomes persist according to (Dinerstein et al., 2017) , parklands
are considered suitable in tropical shrublands, savannas, and grassland.

Annual carbon sequestration potential in above- and below-ground biomass as well as soil was
quantified following IPCC Tier 1 methodology of the 2019 Refinement for agroforestry as
described in (Cardinael, 2018) , combined with maps of FAO climate zones and IPCC
continental regions. Coefficients for parkland systems correspond to 20±1% of values for
silvopastoral systems.

## Cropland areas suitable for silvoarable

#### Geographic coverage
Global

#### Spatial resolution
~5km

### Description
Agroforestry in cropland provides a range of benefits (Kuyah et al., 2019) . However, while trees
and shrubs can provide feed to animals and therefore have the potential to rather compensate
potential adverse impacts on grass growth, it is less clear under what circumstances trees in
cropland benefit crop growth or compete with crops for resources e.g. (Nasielski et al., 2015;
Rosenstock et al., 2019) . Therefore, we opt here for a rather conservative approach, assuming
a moderate fraction of crop fields is planted with tress.

### Methodology
Woody perennials can in principle be planted where annual crops are grown, whereas
substantial competition for water should be avoided. As competition for space and other
resources is likely larger among newly planted trees and existing tree crops, we considered only
silvoarable systems with annual crops herein. Therefore, suitability was constrained by two
factors: (a) aridity, for which a threshold of aridity index &gt; 0.35 was selected, and (b) physical
cropland cultivated with annual crops. The aridity threshold is based on the 90 th percentile of
silvoarable trials (n=116) compiled in (Ma et al., 2020) . These rules result in a suitable area of
760 Mha.

IPCC guidelines provide coefficients for a range of silvoarable systems, grouped in silvoarable,
alley cropping, shading, or hedgerow systems (Cardinael, 2018) . Carbon sequestration rates
and tree densities between and within these systems differ greatly among structurally similar
climate regions on different continents. Herein, we assess two scenarios: (a) alley cropping
systems based on hedgerow coefficients with rather conservative carbon densities, and (b) a
denser silvoarable system that combines coefficients for silvoarable systems for temperate
climates with those of alley cropping systems for tropical climate following the recommendations
in (Cardinael, 2018) :

(a) As hedgerows are globally consistently defined, we assume here that coefficients for
hedgerows can be applied while assuming that these hedges or not only planted on field edges
but also as tree rows within fields, corresponding to low-density alley cropping systems. Carbon
coefficients for hedgerows are reported per kilometer, whereas we assume that 1 km can be
achieved within a hypothetic square field segment of 1 ha size with a tree row spacing of 10 m.
In addition, carbon coefficients and tree densities for hedgerows are comparably conservative
and indicate that – compared to other systems listed above - competition for resources between
main crops and trees is less likely, allowing for a quantification of carbon sequestration without
having to assume potentially substantial yield penalties.

(b) For a denser silvoarable system, we combine coefficients for silvoarable systems in
temperate climates with those of alley cropping systems in tropical climate following the
recommendations in (Cardinael, 2018) . Coefficients for temperate climates are lower in regions
with high mechanization such as the USA, which the authors attribute to wider tree rows that
allow for the use of heavy machinery. This is not apparent for tropic regions, where data
samples may not have been collected in such systems. To account for this effect, we assume
that in pixels dominated by large field size (Lesiv et al., 2019) only half the carbon value can be
achieved.
