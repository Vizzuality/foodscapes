## Areas with High Conservation Value
Areas of global conservation importance for biodiversity

#### Geographic coverage
Global

#### Spatial resolution
10 km resampled to ~5km for display

#### Date of content
2015

### Description
The global conservation importance layers were produced by the [Nature Map Earth project](https://naturemap.earth/)
and integrated the best available global biodiversity, carbon and water data at the time.
In particular, it includes for the first time a representative set of about half of all
plant species globally as well as above, below and soil organic carbon at risk from land use change.

### Methodology
Different combinations of layers integrating biodiversity, carbon and/or water value are presented,
based on the protected area network at the time (covering ~16% of terrestrial land area) or starting from a blank state.
The maps highlight the upper potential value of any global terrestrial land area for conserving these valuable assets
and presented as ranking from most (1) to least importance (100).
More details on the methods can be found in [Jung et al. (2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01528-7/)
and on the data repository.
_The layer displayed here represents the areas with the 10% highest conservation value globally_.

## Agricultural Frontier Zones
Gain in agricultural land since 1992

#### Geographic coverage
Global
#### Spatial resolution
~9 km resampled to ~5km for display

#### Date of content
1992-2015

### Description
Global cropland gain based on a landscape change trajectories mapping approach.
Shown are those areas which had any cropland grain in the period 1992-2015.
See Nowosad et al. (2019) for further details.

### Methodology
Global cropland gain is mapped from ESA maps and compared at the landscape level between 1992 and 2015,
magnitude of pattern change, categories transition matrix for detailed characterization of change,
fractional abundances of plant functional types (PFTs) in 1992 and 2015, and change trend type – a simple,
overall descriptor of the character of landscape change.

## Soil Erosion
Risk of soil degradation and soil carbon loss

#### Geographic coverage
Global

#### Spatial resolution
25 km resampled to ~5km for display

#### Date of content
2012

### Description
This map provides an assessment of global soil erosion for 2012. We used the 250m original data to re-sample at 25km.
In this study 202 countries are included with more than 125 million Km2. The total soil loss has been estimated
to 35 Pg yr-1 of soil eroded in 2001. The estimates are lower compared to past studies in 2012, 35.9 Pg yr-1 -
Increase of 2.5% in soil erosion globally (due to land use change).

### Methodology
The Global Soil Erosion map (GeoTIFF format) at 25km resolution is available for free download in the
European Soil Data Centre (ESDAC). This is based on the Verion 1.1 of the JRC/ UniBasel
"RUSLE-based Global Soil Erosion Modelling platform (GloSEM)". The native resolution is ca. 250m and we provide an
example of those data (at the equator marked with a rectangle).

For creating the global risk map, we identified those 5% (95% percentile) grid cells with the largest risk of soil
erosion globally and modal resampled the resulting mask to a 5km resolution,
recognizing that it is a conservative view of where soil erosion could occur.

## Water Scarcity
Areas with historical recorded water scarcity

#### Geographic coverage
Global

#### Spatial resolution
10 km resampled to ~5km for display

#### Date of content
1971-2000

### Description
The depletion of groundwater resources is a critical measure of the sustainability of food production
and indicates both climatic pressures and consumption by human activities within a watershed.
The characterization of water depletion used is based on calculations from the WaterGAP3 model
to assess a long-term average annual consumed fraction of renewably available water,
then integrates seasonal depletion and dry-year depletion,
also based on WaterGAP3 calculations, with average annual depletion into a unified scale.

### Methodology
Detailed description is made in Brauman et al. (2016).
To create mask of historical groundwater depletion risk,
we considered only those areas with more than 75% groundwater depletion (categories 7-8).
