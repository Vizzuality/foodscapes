### Description
The framework of climate-related risk from IPCC (2014)
focuses on assessing the risk of specific consequences or impacts that may harm a system.
The vulnerability of the system is one of three components of the risk,
with exposure and hazard being the other two components.
Despite the uncertainties concerning development and greenhouse gas emission pathways into the future,
there is a considerable and growing amount of information on the spatial variation of climate change impacts on farming systems around the world,
and on the populations who may be most at risk.

### Methodology
For current climate hazards and climate variability, we used areas where the coefficient of variation of annual rainfall
(the standard deviation divided by the mean, expressed as a percentage)
is currently greater than the median value for the global tropics (24%).
In lower latitudes, climate change is projected to increase this variability,
making both cropping and rangeland production more risky.
Because we have little information on the nature of this variability change,
we used current variability as a proxy for future variability.

Areas of high climatic variability and droughts were identified through a percentile threshold.
