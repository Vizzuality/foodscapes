### Description
Pesticides are commonly applied in most areas with intensively produced crops globally.
However, their use also has consequences for plant and soil heath as well as beneficial ecosystem services and water quality.
We make use of a global mask of pesticide application to identify those areas where pesticides are excessively applied.

### Methodology
Data originates from Tang et al. (2021)
who uses a global database of pesticide applications and a spatially explicit environmental model
to estimate the world geography of environmental pollution risk caused by 92 active ingredients in 168 countries.
The resulting layers are gridded and were utilized to create masks of those areas with the largest 5%
(e.g. Largest 5% (e.g. 95% percentile) of exposed grid cells globally.
