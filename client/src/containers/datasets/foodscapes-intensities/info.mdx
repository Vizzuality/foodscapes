### Description
The production of food is at the heart of global sustainability challenges, with unsustainable practices being a major driver of biodiversity loss, green-house gas emissions and land degradation. The concept of foodscapes, defined as the characteristics of food production along biophysical and socio-economic gradients, could provide an entry point into navigating this nexus. Here we provide a globally consistent approximation of the world’s foodscape classes through the integration of best available global data on biophysical and socio-economic factors so as to identify a minimum set of emergent clusters.

This version is identical to the overall foodscapes layer; however, the mapped classes have been further aggregated to reflect three levels of food production intensity.

### Methodology
Methodology as with the main foodscapes layer, but the layer has been further aggregated to reflect different levels of food production intensity. More details can be found in Jung et al. (2022).
