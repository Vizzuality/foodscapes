### Description
Irrecoverable Carbon 2018 (t/ha) (v1.0) Irrecoverable carbon refers to the vast stores of carbon in nature that are vulnerable to release from human activity and, if lost, could not be restored by 2050 — when the world must reach net-zero emissions to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. This layer shows tonnes of irrecoverable carbon per hectare in both biomass and soils.

### Methodology
Irrecoverable carbon in ecosystems is defined by three criteria: (1) it can be influenced by direct and local human action (‘manageability’), (2) it is potentially vulnerable to lose during land-use conversion (‘vulnerability’) and (3) if lost, it could not be recovered within a specified timeframe (‘recoverability’). Here, we consider recoverability over 30 yr given the IPCC assessment that global emissions must reach net-zero by 2050 to limit global warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels.
To create the irrecoverable carbon map, were:
1. Defined relevant ecosystems that meet criteria 1, manageability.
2. Created a ‘total manageable carbon’ map for terrestrial and coastal ecosystems. This includes aboveground biomass carbon (AGC), belowground biomass carbon (BGC) and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks.
3. Created a ‘vulnerable carbon’ map that considers the portion of biomass carbon (AGC + BGC) and SOC, respectively, that would be released in a typical land-use conversion. The most common drivers of recent destruction/loss in each major ecosystem were used.
4. Determined the amount of lost carbon that could be recovered within 30 yr following a conversion, assuming land abandonment and natural regeneration. Recoverability was based on biomass and SOC sequestration rates by ecosystem.
5. Subtracted ‘recoverable carbon’ from the ‘vulnerable carbon’ map. The balance was the ‘irrecoverable carbon’ map.
