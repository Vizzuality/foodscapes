## Areas suitable for minimum tillage

#### Geographic coverage
Global

#### Spatial resolution
~5km

#### Date of content
November 2022

### Description
Minimum tillage aims at least soil disturbance feasible without compromising crop productivity.
By avoiding soil inversion and residue removal, it minimizes soil organic carbon mineralization
while adding organic matter to the soil.

### Methodology
Suitability for minimum tillage was based on merging two datasets for conservation agriculture
potential (Porwollik et al., 2019; Prestele et al., 2018) . Thereby, each pixel that was determined
as suitable according to either one of the two datasets and their underlying assumptions was
considered as suitable herein.

Carbon sequestration per pixel was determined based Tier 1 methodology of the IPCC
Guidelines 2019 Refinement (Buendia et al., 2019) for a no-till (minimum tillage) scenario
following the same methods as in (Woolf et al., 2020) .

## Areas suitable for cover cropping

#### Geographic coverage
Global

#### Spatial resolution
~5km

#### Date of content
November 2022

### Description
Cover crops provide soil cover outside the main growing season, protecting the soil from
erosion besides other benefits. If not harvested, they also contribute to soil organic carbon
sequestration, which is quantified herein.

### Methodology
Suitability for cover crops was determined by (a) aridity index (AI; (Trabucco and Zomer, 2019) )
&gt; 0.3 and (b) cultivation of annual crops as well as cropping intensity according to SPAM2010
(Yu et al., 2020) . The first constraint was determined by the distribution of the 90 th percentile of
cover cropping experiments in an extensive database (n=317) on soil conservation practice
trials (Jian et al., 2020) . The second rule (b) is based on general capacity for cover cropping.

Carbon sequestration per pixel was determined based Tier 1 methodology of the IPCC
Guidelines 2019 Refinement (Buendia et al., 2019) for a high organic inputs without manure
(cover crops) scenario following the same methods as in (Woolf et al., 2020) .
