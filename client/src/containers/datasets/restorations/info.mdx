### Description
Cropland restoration provides benefits especially where extensive cropland and large fields
prevail. These benefits encompass inter alia the restoration of habitats for wild species, storage
of organic carbon above- and below-ground in the landscape, and improvements in quantity and
quality of water resources (Di Sacco et al., 2021; Larsen and Noack, 2020; Power, 2010;
Samways et al., 2020) . We acknowledge the often beneficial cultivation of perennial crops
compared to annuals (Kreitzman et al., 2020; Ledo et al., 2020) and therefore consider in the
cropland restoration scenario only annual crops. In addition, we exclude crops from the land
sparing for which production is already too low to allow for healthy sustainable diets, i.e. pulses,
legumes and vegetables (Willett et al., 2019) . The latter affects changes in crop production (not
shown) but not the restored area.

### Methodology
Suitability for cropland restoration was based on (a) field size classes as reported by (Lesiv et
al., 2019) and (b) extent of arable land per pixel cultivated with annual crops according to
SPAM2010 (Yu et al., 2020). For (a) we determined all pixels with large or very large field size
suitable. For (b), we estimated that pixels with cropland coverage ≥ 70% are suitable for
restoration. This assumes that also pixels not fully covered by cropland will likely contain other
landscape elements not beneficial for ecosystem functioning, especially built up environment,
which can here not be quantified directly as the cropland dataset is incompatible with general
land cover datasets.

The restored fraction in each suitable pixel was set to 20% of the cropland cultivated with
annual crops and subsequently scaled the area change for individual crops and crop groups to
achieve this value without changing the area of Pulses &amp; Legumes or Vegetables. The value of
20% is at the upper end of fractions of natural vegetation suggested in the literature at which
mutual benefits for biodiversity and agriculture are found (Gagic et al., 2021; Garibaldi et al.,
2020) , although the use of fixed thresholds is contested and other factors such as landscape
diversity may equally drive outcomes (Dainese et al., 2019; Larsen and Noack, 2020; Oehri et
al., 2020; Redlich et al., 2018; Samways et al., 2020) but was not quantified herein.

The carbon sequestration potential in forest vegetation is quantified following IPCC Tier 1
methodology as described in the 2019 Refinement guidelines (Buendia et al., 2019) , providing
region-specific factors for annual growth increment of natural forests, as well as maps of FAO
ecofloristic zones and IPCC continental regions. Coefficients for forest growth are provided for
tree age ≤ 20 years or &gt; 20 years. We select the former corresponding to the time period
quantified herein and combine these with class-specific root to shoot ratios.

Grasslands reach a steady state substantially faster than forests, which is why IPCC guidelines
only provide the carbon content at steady state. We divided these values by 20 years to obtain
the amount of sequestered carbon that can be attributed to each year of a 20 year time period.
For both cases of revegetation, forest and grassland respectively, we assume that reference
SOC values of undisturbed soils are restored within a 20 year time period and the present
values correspond to those under long-term cultivation. I.e., we calculate the annual soil carbon
sequestration potential over a 20 year time period as (SOC ref -SOC ltc )/20.

## Grassland areas for restoration (Forests and tropical grasslands)

#### Geographic coverage
Global

#### Spatial resolution
~5km

#### Date of content
November 2022

### Description
Grassland vegetation has a global extent of around 3000 Mha out of which 1800 Mha can be
considered to serve for livestock grazing, i.e. there is an overlap of datasets for grassland and
pastures (Ramankutty et al., 2008) and ruminants (Gilbert et al., 2018) . Its extent alone
indicates large potential for carbon sequestration if planted or revegetated with trees where this
is ecologically and agronomically feasible. Here, we quantify the potential for restoration of
forest on present grassland and pastures by sparing land via increasing ruminant stocking rates
where this can be assumed to be sustainably feasible. Such approaches have foremost been
studied regionally as in (Latawiec et al., 2015) .

### Methodology
The intervention for grassland restoration is based on feasibility to increase ruminant stocking
rates to free land for restoration in forest biomes according to (Dinerstein et al., 2017) .
Mediterranean forests were excluded due to uncertain and variable productivity. Constraining
the grassland restoration to forest biomes allows for focusing on regions where carbon
outcomes can be maximized via sequestration in tree vegetation while avoiding that growth of
trees may be assumed in environments in which these would not be native.

Determining maximum stocking rates or carrying capacity under sustainable pasture
management remains a challenge as remote sensing products can only provide robust
approximations for unmanaged grass vegetation whereas grazing systems are characterized by
regular removal of biomass and in turn biomass production is grazing or cutting activity.
Simulation models in turn can so far hardly be validated at global scales due to scarcity of data
on management, grass species, etc. This is even more so the case for agroecological
management such as silvopastoral systems.

Therefore, we opt to quantify present stocking rates based on gridded ruminant numbers
(Gilbert et al., 2018) and pasture extent (Ramankutty et al., 2008) and subsequently estimate
the extent of grassland that could be rewilded if livestock density on grassland was increased to
sustainable stocking rates reported in literature. Maximum sustainable stocking rates on agro-
ecologically intensified pastures vary in the literature, with estimates ranging from 1-5 livestock
units (LSU) per hectare (Latawiec et al., 2015; zu Ermgassen et al., 2018) . Herein, we quantify
the grassland sparing potential of increasing stocking rates to 2 LSU ha -1 , i.e., oriented towards
the lower end of the above estimates.

The carbon sequestration potential in forest vegetation is quantified following IPCC Tier 1
methodology as described in the 2019 Refinement guidelines (Buendia et al., 2019) , providing
region-specific factors for annual growth increment of natural forests, as well as maps of FAO
ecofloristic zones and IPCC continental regions. Coefficients for forest growth are provided for
tree age ≤ 20 years or &gt; 20 years. We select the former corresponding to the time period
quantified herein and combine these with class-specific root to shoot ratios.

Grasslands reach a steady state substantially faster than forests, which is why IPCC guidelines
only provide the carbon content at steady state. We divided these values by 20 years to obtain
the amount of sequestered carbon that can be attributed to each year of a 20 year time period.
For both cases of revegetation, forest and grassland respectively, we assume that reference
SOC values of undisturbed soils are restored within a 20 year time period and the present
values correspond to those under long-term cultivation. I.e., we calculate the annual soil carbon
sequestration potential over a 20 year time period as (SOC ref -SOC ltc )/20.
