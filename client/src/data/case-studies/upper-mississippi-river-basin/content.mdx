The landscape of the U.S. Midwest was significantly altered to accommodate extensive agricultural production, most commonly corn, soybean and livestock production. More than 80% of original wetlands in Indiana, Illinois, Ohio and Iowa have been drained, and more than 90% of native prairies lost. Habitat has been converted and fragmented; water quality in lakes, rivers and streams degraded; landscapes left increasingly vulnerable to flooding; and marine life in the Gulf of Mexico affected by accumulated runoff.

This current state is not only bad for biodiversity and water quality, it’s bad for production and livelihoods too. In order to create a food system in this region that is fit for the future, we must create a landscape that is productive, resilient and profitable. And one way to do that is through restoration. Through adopting practices like ‘edge-of-field,’ constructed wetlands, watershed restoration and habitat protection, there is opportunity in the U.S. Midwest to increase farm productivity, reduce regulatory burdens and generate ecosystem services.

Implementing these practices is going to require co- ordination and alignment between multiple initiatives: cropping and livestock systems, supply chains and actors in a particular foodscape, including farmers and ranchers. We will need economic incentives and government policies, such as the U.S. Farm Bill and recently passed Inflation Reduction Act, as instruments to assist in changing generational practices.

### NBS In Action: Restoration

There are many breadbasket foodscapes where degradation of pasture and farmland is an issue and where a combination of topsoil loss and “nutrient mining” mean current levels of productivity will not be maintained once climate change stresses are factored in. In these foodscapes, some areas will need to be targeted for remedial action to restore cropland and grazing lands back (as closely as possible) to their original habitats.

Some land will need to be taken out of production. Even in highly productive foodscapes, there are typically portions of farms that are less productive and profitable, and these can be restored at a lower opportunity cost. Such place-based habitat restoration would emphasize reestablishment of an assemblage of species native to a given foodscape, including beneficial pest predators, pollinators and wild game. Restoration can also provide co-benefits such as carbon sequestration and mitigation of nutrient pollution and erosion.
