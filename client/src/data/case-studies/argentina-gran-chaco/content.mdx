## SYNOPSIS

Argentina Gran Chaco foodscape, part of the larger Gran Chaco region of South America, has long accommodated a mix of uses, including hunting, grazing, and cropping in a region with high endemic biodiversity. Over the last 30 years, however, global demand for soy and beef has driven the destruction of millions of acres of native habitat and forests and led to rapid and large-scale simplification of this vast, complex landscape.

Such land use conversion has obvious consequences for biodiversity and also creates risk for the production of food. Forest clearing, for example, leads to greater rates of soil erosion, flooding, and salinity in croplands. However, there are policies and practices in place that are helping restore the lands and waters while increasing production.

In Argentina, the national government approved a Native Forest Law that limits where land conversion is allowed. In addition to this policy, nature-based solutions, such as the adoption of agrosilvopastoral techniques, offer the potential to protect Gran Chacoâ€™s traditional mixed- use landscape while still producing its economically important commodities and protecting its globally important biodiversity.

## ABOUT THE FOODSCAPE

The entire Gran Chaco is vast and contains part of the Chaco-Pampean Plain, one of the biggest plains on Earth.

Its climate gradient gives rise to a diversity of habitats. The Chaco owes its long history as a hunting ground to its high faunal diversity and abundance. Because of the diversity of habitats, key species of the Gran Chaco include those common in humid forests, such as jaguar and tapir, and those common in dry areas including armadillos.

## BENEFITS AND VALUE OF NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS

The adoption of nature-based solutions, such as sustainable cropping and ranching practices, can mitigate biodiversity loss associated with land conversion by incorporating native vegetation into production landscapes. These practices can also help restore land that has been degraded through long-term production.

Incorporating nature-based solutions improves productivity, diversifies and increases yearly profits, and prevents land degradation. For grazing systems this would come from introducing silvopasture. For mixed livestock-cropping systems these opportunities come from adding forest buffers, silvopasture and cover crops.

Across the Argentina Gran Chaco foodscape, mixed land use practices could nearly double farm income. However, the transition costs would be more than the current farm profit. Farms will require new sources of capital to support this transition.
