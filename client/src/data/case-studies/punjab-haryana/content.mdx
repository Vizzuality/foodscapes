The Punjab-Haryana region in India is an intensively cultivated breadbasket where Green Revolution innovations in crop breeding led to high-input, high yielding rice and wheat agriculture. That crop combination, in addition to government provision of free electricity to rural areas, drove high rates of groundwater pumping and overdraft.

Subsequent policy to limit dry-season irrigation led to a narrower window between rice harvest and wheat planting, which inadvertently contributed to large scale crop residue burning as a way to quickly prepare fields for wheat. At peak burning periods, agriculture burning contributes around 30% of fine particulate matter in New Delhi, the capital, where it causes respiratory harm, contributes to climate change, and disproportionately affects the poor who are less able to take adaptive measures. Technical solutions have been developed to enable seeding wheat without burning rice residue, but these technologies have not been adopted as widely as necessary despite public investment.

Lasting solutions to both water depletion and poor air quality here require combined and complementary approaches, including nature-based solutions for managing farms without the need for burning.

Adoption of nature-based and other relevant solutions can be accelerated by providing a clear context for aligning public policy and economic incentives around multiple outcomes, including crop production, air quality and water security.

### NBS In Action: Soil Health
The range of techniques necessary to improve soil health are well-known: cover cropping and mulching, crop rotation and minimizing soil disturbance through minimum tillage, rotational grazing and the seeding of legumes, among others. The combination of such practices improves soil structure and stores carbon, which in turn helps to reduce erosion, improve soil moisture and provide other ecosystem services, such as nutrient recycling. Almost all terrestrial foodscapes have room to improve soil health; the more intensive the foodscape, the greater the opportunity.
