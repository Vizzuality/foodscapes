As its name indicates, the Chesapeake Bay Watershed spans terrestrial and marine environments and highlights the connections between the two. The Chesapeake watershed helps frame the cause-and- effect relationship between upstream food producers and downstream consumers, but with a bit of a twist. In this foodscape, many downstream consumers are also food producers (seafood such as oysters and blue crabs) and their quality of life and livelihoods are doubly threatened by excess nutrients flowing into the bay.

Looking at solutions through a foodscape-scale approach — especially in the case of such a distributed, yet interdependent ecosystems — shows how integrated nature-based solutions such as oyster reef restoration, could significantly contribute to improving water quality by removing excess nutrients directly from the waters of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries.

Oysters are nature’s water filter, and a single healthy adult can filter as much as 50 gallons of water a day. Still, as powerful as they are, restoring oyster reefs alone will not be enough for bay states to meet nutrient- reduction targets set by the federal government. Fortunately, the establishment of the Chesapeake

Bay Watershed Agreement, a multi-state and multi- organizational partnership, created a unique policy framework for interstate action toward reaching those environmental goals. And the bay’s health is improving. Promising improvements in water quality to date are largely due to three factors: strong investment in science and the development of quantitative nutrient targets; several decades of action and investment, even before formal nutrient reduction targets were established; and political support and buy-in from the communities within the watershed.

Overlaying where enabling conditions and successful nutrient-reduction programs are in place across the foodscape could help decision makers pinpoint areas of maximum need and potential for meeting nutrient reduction targets.

Ultimately, success in the Chesapeake will depend on a combination of regulation, public and private investment to support nature-based and other solutions, including environmental restoration, as well as the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices, and support from the broader supply chain to incentivize sustainable nutrient management.

### NBS In Action: Nutrient Management

Meeting nutrient needs is a central challenge of farming and grazing, but nutrient pollution, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, is a major cause of freshwater and marine pollution, and in the case of nitrogen a significant contributor to climate change. Some foodscapes suffer from overuse of nutrients, others have nutrient deficits.

There are many well-known ways to strike a balance: targeting fertilizer application more precisely, integrating nutrient-fixing legumes into crop rotations, optimizing the reuse of animal manure and diverting human manure from urban areas back to farmland.
