The Upper Tana River Basin in Kenya is a diverse, high- elevation smallholder production landscape that is an important source of food for the 9 million inhabitants of the greater Nairobi area. Farmers in the foodscape also export peppers, tomatoes and avocado — mostly to Europe — making this small-holder farming landscape simultaneously crucial for local food demand in one of the most important urban centers in Africa, and a key supplier to international markets. In addition to food, the watershed also provides drinking water for these same 9 million people, as well as 50% of Kenya’s electricity supply through a series of hydropower dams along the Tana River.

Located downstream from the important watershed means Nairobi is relatively close to an important food supply, it also means that soil erosion damages the hydroelectric and drinking water infrastructure. This urban proximity offers an opportunity to reap the benefits of planning at the foodscape level, connecting economic and environmental solutions that benefit both urban consumers and upstream suppliers. In fact, one such market-based approach is already at work in the basin.

The Upper Tana-Nairobi Water Fund, an existing public-private partnership, shows how the right policies, conditions and alignment of incentives can support changes in land management practices that reduce erosion, including terracing, water collection basins (water pans) and agroforestry. The water fund mechanism directs investment from downstream commercial and industrial water users toward upstream conservation and agricultural practices to lower sedimentation rates, ultimately reducing infrastructure costs downstream. Water funds, like the one in the Upper Tana River Basin, show that market- based approaches are most effective when paired with innovation from the private sector and strong enabling conditions — policies and social norms, for example — that allow benefits to be shared equitably.


### NBS In Action: Water Management

Water is critical to all life and is one of the foundational elements to agriculture, which accounts for 70-90% of total global freshwater consumption, making it the biggest anthropogenic driver of water depletion. Whether too much or too little, water is also one of the most visible impacts of climate change that is acutely felt in agriculture.

Opportunities for improved water management are many, and we’ve chosen to focus on: improved rainwater harvesting; increasing irrigation efficiency; replacing crops with high water requirements such as cotton and rice with crops with lower water requirements, such as sorghum or millet; direct seeding and alternate wetting and drying; and investments in source water protection, such as locally-managed water funds.
