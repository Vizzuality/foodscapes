## SYNOPSIS

Central New Zealand is one of the largest shellfish producers in the world. In addition to supplying global markets, seafood has played a central role in the culture and foodways of indigenous communities for centuries. Yet, the Central New Zealand Aquaculture foodscape has limited space to expand operations in near-shore areas, constraining the opportunity for growth in this highly sustainable food source, and is also vulnerable to environmental and economic shocks because of its focus on a relatively small number of species.

Open-water and near-shore restorative aquaculture provide an opportunity to increase the productivity and resilience of the foodscape by adding a seaweed sector to diversify production. But despite strong potential for diversified aquaculture within the foodscape, there is still need to develop both the markets for diversified products and the infrastructure needed for this approach to be effective at scale.

## FOODSCAPES EXTENSION

Mariculture — aquaculture in marine environments — in the Central New Zealand Aquaculture foodscape takes place in three ecoregional provinces that span the main islands (northeastern, central, and southern New Zealand) and a range of sheltered and exposed, subtropical, temperate, and subarctic environments.

Aquaculture production has averaged 107,097 tons per annum from 2010 to 2020, with production comprised of a total of four shellfish and finfish species valued at more than $800 million. Approximately three-quarters of the country’s mussel production (green-lipped mussel, Perna canaliculus) and two-thirds of fin-fish production (King salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) occurs in this foodscape. Currently, more than 600 farmers make up the green-lipped mussel industry, many of which farm an area less than 10 ha in size, often as small as 3 ha.

## BENEFITS AND VALUE OF NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS

The Government of New Zealand has outlined a vision to become a “globally recognized world leader in sustainable and innovative aquaculture across the value chain” and has a stated goal of expanding to a $1 billion industry by 2025.

The first of four outcomes listed in the national government’s aquaculture strategy is environmental sustainability, which suggests nature-based solutions, such as restorative aquaculture, will be foundational to improvements and expansions in the aquaculture industry.

Economic modeling has assessed the theoretical addition of seaweed farming of kelp, Ecklonia radiata, under two transition scenarios in the Marlborough Sound within the Central New Zealand foodscape (one of the most favored and high-density farming areas in New Zealand). One scenario focuses on a 5 ha mussel farm integrating seaweed in its farming operations alone, and the other focuses on a farm that integrates seaweed in its operations while being part of a cooperative that jointly owns the seaweed nursery and processing facilities.

In this scenario, mussel farmers could increase income through integration of seaweeds, by an estimated $35,000 per year. If farming activities are vertically integrated, including a hatchery for production of seed through a cooperative approach as in scenario two, it is estimated that income would rise significantly, to $82,000 per year, a 133% increase over farming individually.

Longer term, restorative aquaculture might also provide the opportunity to engage with greenhouse gas emissions reduction of farming operations and abatement strategies for other industries, such as through the use of seaweed for production of biofuels or biochar (to improve soil carbon sequestration).
