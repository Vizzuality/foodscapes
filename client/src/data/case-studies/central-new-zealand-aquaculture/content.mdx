Central New Zealand is one of the largest shellfish producers in the world. In addition to supplying global markets, seafood has played a central role in the culture and foodways of Indigenous communities for centuries. Yet, the Central New Zealand Aquaculture region has limited space to expand operations in near-shore areas, constraining the opportunity for growth in this highly sustainable food source, and is also vulnerable to environmental and economic shocks because of its focus on a relatively small number of species.

Open-water and near-shore restorative aquaculture practices provide an opportunity to increase the productivity and resilience of the foodscape by adding a seaweed sector to diversify production. But despite strong potential for diversified aquaculture within the foodscape, there is still need to develop both the markets for diversified products and the infrastructure needed for this approach to be effective at scale. In the case of seaweed, barriers to human consumption likely need to be addressed more broadly, including public perceptions around food safety and the viability of seaweed as a dietary staple.

In terms of infrastructure development, emergent programs already highlight the potential for regional partnerships to catalyze sector-wide development, such as Seaweed for Europe. These programs provide a valuable analogue for collaboration on shared challenges and offer learnings in the development of markets and technology, in this foodscape, in New Zealand more broadly, and across other marine foodscapes and regions.

### NBS In Action: Restorative aquaculture and fisheries

Improved fisheries management and extending aquaculture production can significantly increase output from freshwater and marine foodscapes while also delivering environmental co-benefits in the form of reduced water pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.
